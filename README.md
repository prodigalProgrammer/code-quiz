## Usage

Once the start button is clicked the quiz will start.

- Selecting a wrong answer will deducted 10 seconds from your timer.
- Selecting a right answer will add 5 points to your final score.
- As you play along, the timer will countdown to zero which will be the end of the game.
- There is also a possibility of answering all questions to end the game.
